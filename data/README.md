# README for Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the project.

## contours.json

The `contours.json` file is used to store the contours extracted from images. The contours are saved in a JSON format, which allows for easy reading and writing by other programs.

### Usage

- The contours are generated by the `extract_cnts_box.py` script and saved using the `save_contours.py` script.
- To load the contours for further processing, use the `load_contours.py` script, which reads the contours from this JSON file.

Ensure that the `contours.json` file is present in this directory before attempting to load contours.
